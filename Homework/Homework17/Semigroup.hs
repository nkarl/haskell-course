-- This is the type of a NonEmpty list:
data NonEmpty a = a :| [a] deriving (Show, Eq)

l1, l2, l3 :: NonEmpty Int
l1 = 1 :| [2, 3]
l2 = 4 :| [5, 6]
l3 = 7 :| [8, 9]

l4, l5 :: NonEmpty Char
l4 = 'h' :| "ello"
l5 = 'w' :| "orld"

--- As you can see, because we alwas have to provide the first `a`, we can never have an empty list.
-- Now, define a Semigroup instance for NonEmpty:

--  TODO: Define the Semigroup instance for NonEmpty
instance Semigroup (NonEmpty a) where
  (x :| xs) <> (y :| ys) = x :| go xs (y : ys)
   where
    go [] ys = ys
    go (x : xs) ys = x : go xs ys

-- Test it out

--- >>> l1 <> l2
-- 1 :| [2,3,4,5,6]

--- >>> l4 <> l5
-- 'h' :| "elloworld"

--- >>> (l1 <> l2) <> l3 == l1 <> (l2 <> l3)
-- True

-- Now, try to define a Monoid instance for NonEmpty.
-- You'll notice that it's not possible to do so because there's
-- no identity element for NonEmpty.

-- instance Monoid (NonEmpty a) where
--  mempty = undefined
