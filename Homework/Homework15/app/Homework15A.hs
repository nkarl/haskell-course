-- This is a CLI application that allows the user to manage a TODO list.
-- The user can add and remove items from the list and save and load the list
-- from a path.
-- It's a working prototype, but it has some bugs. Specifically, it doesn't
-- handle errors very well. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
-- fix those bugs and make the application more robust. Hint: Try to interact
-- with the application in unexpected ways and see what happens! You should be
-- able to find and fix 3 bugs.
